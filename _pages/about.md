Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.me.utexas.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Zhenghui Sha](https://www.me.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/sha). I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and my M.S. and B.Eng. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). Before my Ph.D., I gained a year of valuable industry experience at [SAIC Volkswagen in Shanghai](https://volkswagengroupchina.com.cn/en/partner/saicvolkswagen).  

Openings
======
I’m thrilled to share that I’ll be joining the Department of Systems Engineering at Colorado State University as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in Fall 2025! 

**Ph.D. Positions:** My research group, the [COSINE LAB](https://cosine-lab.github.io/cosinelab.org/), will have 1–2 fully funded Ph.D. openings starting in Spring 2026 or Fall 2026. If you’re interested in research about complex systems, network science, or data-driven design. I’d love to hear from you! To apply, please email me at [Yinshuang.Xiao@colostate.edu](mailto:yinshuang.xiao@colostate.edu) with the subject line “*GRA Application to Cosine Lab*.” and include your CV, transcripts, and a brief summary of your research interests and experience. For full details, see the [*Call For Application*](/files/PhD_Recuit_Cosine_Lab_CSU.pdf)

**Undergrad and MS students:** If my research topics excite you, don't hesitate to reach out at [Yinshuang.Xiao@colostate.edu](mailto:yinshuang.xiao@colostate.edu) with the subject line “*Perspective Undergrad / MS to Cosine Lab*.” I’m always happy to chat about research opportunities, collaborations, or just share more about our work.

Due to the high volume of emails, I may not be able to respond to every inquiry individually. However, I carefully review all submissions and will reach out to candidates who are a strong fit for available opportunities. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
