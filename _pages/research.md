The central hypothesis of my dissertation research is that the statistically significant local connections of individual entities, embedding collective behaviors of entities, are crucial function units of socio-technical systems (STSs), influencing global-level system performance. A paradigmatic example is the shared mobility network, such as bike-sharing systems. Compared to individual stations that only record users’ rental and return behaviors, local service systems formed by several stations (e.g., a triangle of three stations) capture users’ travel behaviors within the local network (e.g., a triangle transit). A better understanding of such a subsystem can help better probe into users’ mobility patterns and local resource distribution, which are critical for the optimal decision-making of system engineers and operators. Despite the significance of local network structures and behaviors, existing work has primarily focused on investigating individual entities and the impact of their behaviors on system-level performance. Therefore, a fundamental knowledge gap exists in understanding and utilizing meaningful local network structures for STS engineering and design. My dissertation has contributed to the current literature by creating a novel local-level network-based framework for STS engineering and design, combining three advanced network theories and models, including network motif theory, exponential random graph model (ERGM), and graph neural network (GNN) model. In particular, this framework contains two steps. In Step 1, I developed an approach to identifying statistically significant local network motifs (i.e., recurring network patterns) and analyzing their impacts on system structure and performance. In Step 2, I developed a new STS engineering and design approach based on the local information obtained from Step 1.
